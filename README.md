# Poll Everywhere API Gem

Integrate Poll Everywhere into your Ruby applications.

# TODO
A roadmap for our API:

* Build an app layer that we can put on top of a sync/async backend.
* Build out a serialization layer for the model class (to_json,from_json,etc)
* Implement specs that validate app layer
* Implement specs that validate protocol/API layer
* Implement documentation system around protocol/API layer specs so that we can run our specs againts a staging environment and validate that it works.
